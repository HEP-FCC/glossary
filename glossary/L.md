# L

## LGAD: Low gain avalanche detectors

## LEP

The large electron–positron collider, which was operated at CERN until 2000.

## LEP3

A concept for an electron-positron collider in the existing LHC tunnel with a centre-of-mass of
240 GeV and a peak luminosity of $1 × 10 ^{34} cm^{−2} s^{−1}$ at each of two experiments.

## LHCb

A general purpose LHC experiment. LHCb has developed many packages that have been adopted by FCC (see Gaudi.)
See our [private](http://HEP-FCC.web.cern.ch/HEP-FCC/) or [public](http://HEP-FCC-public.web.cern.ch/HEP-FCC-public/) websites.

## LHeC

A study to extend the current LHC collider with an energy recovery Linac (ERL) to generate
electron beams and to collide them with high-energetic proton or ion beams of the LHC.

## Luminosity Levelling (lumi levelling)

Procedure of adjust LHC beam parameters such that the instantaneous luminosity stays constant as function of time, although the beam current decreases.
