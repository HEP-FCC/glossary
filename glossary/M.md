## MADX 

MAD-X (Methodical Accelerator Design) is a project and computational physics software to aid particle accelerator design and simulation. https://cern.ch/mad

## MDI: Machine-Detector Interface

The machine detector interface refers to the topics and regions where the beamlines of the acceler-
ator overlap with the physics experimentâ€™s detector. Key elements include mechanical support of
final beamline elements, luminosity monitoring, feedback, background suppression and radiation
shielding.

## MDISim
A tool set developed in the frame of the FCC study for Machine Detector Interface SIMulations
using and combining the standard tools MAD-X, ROOT and GEANT4.

## MoU: Memorandum of Understanding {#MoU}
