## TDR: Technical Design Report {#TDR}

A document submitted to the «LHCC» of CERN describing the design of a subdetector or other subsystem (e.g. online, trigger, computing).
This document also describes the cost of the detector and which institutes will be responsible for which elements of the construction.
The TDRs of LHCb and the upgrades are collected [here](http://cdsweb.cern.ch/search?cc=LHCb+Reports&ln=en&jrec=11).
The document is reviewed by the «LHCC», with involvement from the «RRB» for financial aspects.


## Tier (Grid) {#Tier}

Grid sites are split into tiers depending on their resources. Tier 1 (i.e. RAL, PIC) and tier 2 sites (mostly universities) store data, the tier 1s in particular storing raw data. The tier 3 sites do not store data. See [here for details](http://wlcg-public.web.cern.ch/tier-centres).


## Track

The signature that is reconstructed when a charged particle travels through the detector.
